# Milk-Quality-Prediction-Using-R

This project in R focuses on predicting milk quality using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. In this project I split the data into training and test sets, perform 10-fold cross-validation, and assess prediction accuracy. Additionally, I analyze model performance using confusion matrices, precision, and recall metrics. This comprehensive approach enables robust evaluation and prediction of milk quality based on chosen attributes.
